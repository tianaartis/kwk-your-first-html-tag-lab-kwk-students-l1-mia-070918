# Your First HTML Tag

## Objectives

1. Code an `h1` tag in `index.html`
2. Set the inner text of the `h1` to `Hello, World!`

## Instructions

In this lab, we're going to create our first HTML tags. We'll be working in the
`index.html` file within this repository, so go ahead and open the file in your
text editor to get started.

## Deliverables

* Add an `h1` tag inside `index.html`
* Inside the `h1` tag, add `Hello, World!` as the inner text

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages
that you can use to debug your code â€” read them closely for hints!

## Viewing your work in the browser

Remember, your general workflow should center on writing code in the text editor
and periodically running the test suite in the terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in
your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the
visual layout in the browser.

To do this while using learn.co and the in-browser IDE, in the IDE terminal, run
`httpserver`.  In the terminal, you will see a message similar to:

```
Your server is running at 174.138.35.103:55323
```

Copy the entire string of numbers, open a new tab and paste the numbers in.
Your `index.html` file will appear (make sure there is content in the file,
otherwise it will show up blank!).

If you're using a local development environment, you can open the HTML file
directly in your browser. If you're coding in the Learn IDE, check out this
[Help Center
article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide)
that explains how to spin up and connect to a simple remote server.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to
it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see
the changes instantly!
